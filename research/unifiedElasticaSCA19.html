        We present a unified method to simulate deformable elastic bodies
        consisting of mixed-dimensional components represented with potentially
        non-manifold simplicial meshes. Building on well-known simplicial rod, shell, and
        solid models for elastic continua, we categorize and define a comprehensive palette expressing all
        possible constraints and elastic energies for stiff and flexible
        connections between the 1D, 2D, and 3D components of a single conforming simplicial
        mesh. This palette consists of three categories: point
        connections, in which simplices meet at a single vertex around which they
        may twist and bend; curve connections in which simplices share an
        edge around which they may rotate (bend) relative to one another; and
        surface connections, in which a shell is embedded on or into a solid.  To define elastic behaviors across non-manifold point connections, we adapt and apply parallel transport concepts from elastic rods. To address discontinuous forces that would otherwise arise when large accumulated relative rotations wrap around in the space of angles, we develop an incremental angle-update strategy.  Our method provides a conceptually
        simple, flexible, and highly expressive framework for designing complex elastic
        objects, by modeling the geometry with a single simplicial mesh
        and decorating its elements with appropriate physical models (rod, shell,
        solid) and connection types (point, curve, surface). We demonstrate a
        diverse set of possible interactions achievable with our method, through
        technical and application examples, including scenes featuring complex aquatic creatures, children's toys, and umbrellas.
